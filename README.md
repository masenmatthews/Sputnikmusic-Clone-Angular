### By Masen Matthews

## Description
  This application uses Angular to "clone" and/or replicate the functionality of the music blog Sputnikmusic. The actual site can be found at sputnikmusic.com. Sputnikmusic allows users to submit reviews, lists, and news. There is also a separate blog component, a sidebar with trending albums, etc.

  Exact functionality may not be copied in all cases. Sputnikmusic operates a comprehensive database that separates music, artists, and albums in a variety of ways. The goal of this project is to clone essential functionality that could help the aspiring music enthusiast get started with building a site that could spawn a community and host a variety of voices and viewpoints.
